    "\tmel scale: \n",
    "\tThe mel scale, named by Stevens, Volkmann, and Newman in 1937, is a perceptual scale of pitches judged by listeners to be equal in distance from one another. The reference point between this scale and normal frequency measurement is defined by assigning a perceptual pitch of 1000 mels to a 1000 Hz tone, 40 dB above the listener's threshold. Above about 500 Hz, increasingly large intervals are judged by listeners to produce equal pitch increments. As a result, four octaves on the hertz scale above 500 Hz are judged to comprise about two octaves on the mel scale. The name mel comes from the word melody to indicate that the scale is based on pitch comparisons.\n",
    "\tSpectrogram:\n",
    "\tFourier Transform is a function that gets a signal in the time domain as input, and outputs its decomposition into frequencies.\n",
    "\t1. Separate to windows: Sample the input with windows of size n_fft=2048, making hops of size hop_length=512 each time to sample the next window.\n",
    "\t2. Compute FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) for each window to transform from time domain to frequency domain.\n",
    "\t3. Generate a Mel scale: Take the entire frequency spectrum, and separate it into n_mels=128 evenly spaced frequencies.\n",
    "And what do we mean by evenly spaced? not by distance on the frequency dimension, but distance as it is heard by the human ear.\n",
    "\t4. Generate Spectrogram: For each window, decompose the magnitude of the signal into its components, corresponding to the frequencies in the mel scale.\n",
